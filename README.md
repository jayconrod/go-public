This repository contains open source packages I write for various things. I just created this repo, so there's not much here yet.

- [ctxio](https://pkg.go.dev/jayconrod.com/ctxio) - functions for performing input and output operations that can be cancelled via context.
- [pathutil](https://pkg.go.dev/jayconrod.com/pathutil) - additional functions for handling paths that aren't in the standard library but probably ought to be.
